# GO is one of the fast programming languages.(Python, JavaScript)  

## Converting humand readable code to binary is compiling the code, CPU or other PC items can not understand :-)
## Compiled program doesn't need source code to run. 

## We can run our code with go run <programname.go> like interpreter (Python, JavaScript) languages

## We can use "go build <programname.go> " so we can give our program in executable version without sharing our code.

## Compiled code is faster, efficent, We don't need dependencies. we can run the code after build with Docker container. Webhook handler program. Build the go code use in container. Webhook Handler 

## Go programs lightweighted on memory because of "Go Runtime". Each program include a small program <Go runtime>. Go runtime clean up the unused memory.
