# Go Variable Types
In Go, there are different types of variables, for example:
```
int- stores integers (whole numbers), such as 123 or -123
float32- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool- stores values with two states: true or false
```
## Define variable => var variablename type = value

## 2. With the := sign:
means that the compiler decides the type of the variable, based on the value
## Define variable => variablename := value
